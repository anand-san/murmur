# Murmur - Voice-Activated AI Assistant

## Product Overview

Murmur is a desktop application that enables seamless voice-to-AI interaction through a minimalist, non-intrusive interface. The application allows users to quickly record voice snippets using global keyboard shortcuts, automatically transcribes the audio, and presents the transcription to an AI assistant for immediate responseâ€”all within a streamlined workflow.

## Key Features

### 1. Effortless Voice Recording

- **Global Shortcut Activation**: Record anytime by pressing and holding Command/Meta + ` (backtick)
- **Visual Feedback**: Minimalist floating window with a pulsing orb indicates active recording
- **Audio Cues**: Distinct sounds play at the start and end of recording sessions
- **Release to Process**: Simply release the shortcut key to end recording and trigger processing

### 2. Intelligent Audio Processing

- **Automatic Transcription**: Voice recordings are converted to text using local processing
- **Duration Filtering**: Only processes recordings longer than 1 second to avoid accidental activations
- **Background Processing**: All audio handling happens in separate threads for optimal performance

### 3. AI Assistant Integration

- **Contextual Responses**: AI processes transcribed text and provides relevant responses
- **Dedicated Interaction Window**: Clean interface for viewing AI responses and continued conversation
- **Direct Access**: Alternative shortcut (Alt + `) to access the AI assistant directly with text input
- **Conversation Threading**: Support for ongoing conversations with context preservation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- React + TypeScript with TailwindCSS for responsive UI
- Multiple specialized windows (main app, recorder feedback, AI interaction)
- UI components from assistant-ui for rich message formatting

### Backend

- Rust-powered Tauri framework for native performance
- Secure, efficient audio processing pipeline
- State machine architecture to manage recording and processing states
- Multi-threaded design with non-blocking I/O for responsive experience

### Integration Capabilities
